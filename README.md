# DeRef

# Project Description

## User Journey
# Step 1: Wallet Connection
Users access the DeRef platform and connect their preferred wallet (e.g., Metamask, Wallet Connect) to their DeRef account. The platform supports multiple wallet options for user convenience

# Step 2: Profile Verification
Users verify their profile using World ID, a decentralized identity verification system
They scan the World ID code and receive a confirmation message upon successful verification

# Step 3: Referral Actions
Users can choose between two actions: generating a referral code or using an existing referral code
If generating a referral code, users click on the "New Referral Code" button

# Step 4: Referral Code Generation
Upon clicking "New Referral Code," users receive a unique invite link 
The invite link can be easily copied and shared on various web2 social media

# Step 5: Referral Rewards
Users earn rewards when their referred individuals successfully refer others
The referral chain continues up to a maximum of 3 referrals per user
Users receive their rewards once the referral conditions are met (i.e. their referred individuals have made certain purchases)

# Step 6: Using a Referral Code
If users choose to use an existing referral code, they click on the "Use Referral Code" button
The user copies the referral link provided by their referee
The user can share this referral link with a maximum of 3 other users

# Step 7: Automatic Referral Rewards
When a referred user joins the platform using the shared referral link, they automatically receive a payment in the form of a token directly in their connected wallet. This royalty system incentivizes users to join the platform and encourages them to refer others

# Step 8: Referral Chain Perpetuation
Each newly onboarded user has the potential to refer a maximum of 3 friends, continuing the referral chain
As new users join through referral links, they also receive the token reward in their wallet
This creates a self-perpetuating referral system that incentivizes user growth and engagement
